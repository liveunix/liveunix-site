# liveunix

we store and collect data about linux distributions and bsd operating systems.
data consists in all useful informations about the systems design along with the latest versions and the up-to-date download links for live iso and stage3 tarball.

since the pages are generated from an external repository, anyone can use the
same dataset to create their own site.

the short term goal is to have a site owned by the community, where it's easy
contribute to, unlike [distrowatch](https://distrowatch.com).
there will be no ads, no news and no fancy features, this will be just a simple
and minimal site.

the long term is to have many sites with different interface but same
underlaying data used for the pages and to develop a live multiboot program
that make use of the iso donwload links.

liveunix will be divided in four part:

- distributions and bsd data
- minimal static site
- rest api systems
- lumi (liveunix multiboot iso)

this project is inspired by [livecdlist.com](https://livecdlist.com) and [glim](github.com(thias/glim).

special thanks to neofetch for the ascii art.
