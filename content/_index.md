# liveunix

we store and collect data about linux distributions and bsd systems.
data consists in all useful information about the systems along with the latest
version and the up-to-date download links to iso and stage3.

since the pages are generated from an external repository, anyone can use the
same dataset to create their own site.

the short term goal is to have a site owned by the community where, unlike
distrowatch.com, it's easy contribute to.
there will be no ads, no news and no fancy feature, this will be just a simple
and minimal site.

the long term is to have many sites with different ui but same data used to
generate the pages and to have a live multiboot program that make use of the
iso donwload links.

liveunix will be divided in four part:

- distributions and bsd systems data
- minimal static site
- rest api to use data
- live multiboot usb (forked from [glim](github.com(thias/glim))) (wip)

this site is inspired by [livecdlist.com](https://livecdlist.com).

special thanks to neofetch for the ascii art.
